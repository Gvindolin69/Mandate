# Mandate

## Description

A simple application that needs refactoring.

## Tasks

1. There are only three levels of mandate: 0, 1, 2;
2. If the level of the mandate cannot be determined, then by default it should be 0;
3. Obtaining mandatory levels for at least 1000 iterations;
4. Change anything in the /src except of `TestLibrary.java`;
5. It is nice if program will have some good logs;
6. (EXTRA) A few unit tests are also appreciated.
